## Visual CNN Hyperparameter Analysis for Image Segmentation Via Pre-trained Network Features

This is the second code part to my bachelors thesis.
Data was collected using my first repo: https://github.com/mkais13/unet-ba.
This app was programmed using Dash, a python library for interactive data visualization.
To start the app, run the `dashmain.py` file in an environment created using the requirements files (preferrably conda). If you wish to read my thesis, feel free to contact me through my e-mail!
